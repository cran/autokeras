install_autokeras(
  method = c("auto", "virtualenv", "conda"),
  conda = "auto",
  version = "1.0.12",
  keras = "default",
  tensorflow = "2.3.0",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Installation method ("virtualenv" or "conda")}

\item{conda}{Path to conda executable (or "auto" to find conda using the
PATH and other conventional install locations).}

\item{version}{Version of AutoKeras to install. Specify "default" to install
the latest release. Otherwise specify an alternate version (e.g. "0.3.5").
The default value is "1.0.12" as it is the latest tested version.}

\item{keras}{Keras version to install. Specify "default" to install
the latest release. Otherwise specify an alternate version (e.g. "2.2.2").}

\item{tensorflow}{TensorFlow version to install. Specify "default" to install
the CPU version of the latest release. Specify "gpu" to install the GPU
version of the latest release.

You can also provide a full major.minor.patch specification (e.g. "1.1.0"),
appending "-gpu" if you want the GPU version (e.g. "1.1.0-gpu").

Alternatively, you can provide the full URL to an installer binary (e.g.
for a nightly binary).}

\item{extra_packages}{Additional PyPI packages to install along with
Keras and TensorFlow.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[tensorflow:install_tensorflow]{tensorflow::install_tensorflow()}}.}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
AutoKeras, Keras, and TensorFlow will be installed into an "r-tensorflow"
virtual or conda environment. Note that "virtualenv" is not available on
Windows (as this isn't supported by TensorFlow).

\section{GPU Installation}{


Keras and TensorFlow can be configured to run on either CPUs or GPUs. The CPU
version is much easier to install and configure so is the best starting place
especially when you are first learning how to use Keras. Here's the guidance
on CPU vs. GPU versions from the TensorFlow website:

- *TensorFlow with CPU support only*. If your system does not have a NVIDIA®
GPU, you must install this version. Note that this version of TensorFlow is
typically much easier to install, so even if you have an NVIDIA GPU, we
recommend installing this version first.

- *TensorFlow with GPU support*. TensorFlow programs typically run
significantly faster on a GPU than on a CPU. Therefore, if your system has a
NVIDIA® GPU meeting all prerequisites and you need to run
performance-critical applications, you should ultimately install this
version.

To install the GPU version:

1) Ensure that you have met all installation prerequisites including
   installation of the CUDA and cuDNN libraries as described in
   [TensorFlow GPU Prerequistes](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation_gpu.html#prerequisites).

2) Pass `tensorflow = "gpu"` to `install_autokeras()`. For example:

    ```
      install_autokeras(tensorflow="gpu")
    ````
}

\section{Windows Installation}{


The only supported installation method on Windows is "conda". This means that
you should install Anaconda 3.x for Windows prior to installing Keras.
}

\section{Custom Installation}{


Installing Keras and TensorFlow using `install_autokeras()` isn't required
to use the Keras R package. You can do a custom installation of Keras (and
desired backend) as described on the
[Keras website](https://keras.io/#installation) and the Keras R package will
find and use that version.

See the documentation on [custom installations](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation.html#custom-installation)
for additional information on how version of Keras and TensorFlow are located
by the Keras package.
}

\section{Additional Packages}{


If you wish to add additional PyPI packages to your Keras / TensorFlow
environment you can either specify the packages in the `extra_packages`
argument of `install_autokeras()`,  or alternatively install them into an
existing environment using the [reticulate::py_install()] function.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# default installation
library("autokeras")
install_autokeras()

# install using a conda environment (default is virtualenv)
install_autokeras(method = "conda")

# install with GPU version of TensorFlow
# (NOTE: only do this if you have an NVIDIA GPU + CUDA!)
install_autokeras(tensorflow = "gpu")

# install a specific version of TensorFlow
install_autokeras(tensorflow = "1.2.1")
install_autokeras(tensorflow = "1.2.1-gpu")

# install a specific version of Keras and TensorFlow
install_autokeras(keras = "2.2.2", tensorflow = "1.2.1")
